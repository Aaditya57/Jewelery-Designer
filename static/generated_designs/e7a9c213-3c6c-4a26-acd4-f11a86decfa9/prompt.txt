A stunning platinum pendant necklace, featuring a 10ct, cushion-cut London Blue Topaz,  set in a delicate, hand-hammered platinum bezel. The platinum displays a softly brushed finish, contrasting with the highly polished facets of the topaz which sparkle intensely. Intricate, swirling filigree work, reminiscent of Japanese art nouveau, extends from the bezel, creating a halo effect around the topaz.  The pendant hangs from a fine, platinum chain with a secure, hidden clasp. The necklace is photographed on a Japanese model with light skin and dark hair,  wearing a simple white silk shirt.  The background is a subtly blurred, soft white bokeh, providing a clean, minimalist aesthetic.  The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a gentle glow on the platinum and enhancing the deep blue saturation of the topaz.  The shot is a close-up macro shot, slightly elevated, focusing on the pendant and showcasing the intricate details of both the metalwork and the stone.  The overall mood is sophisticated, luxurious, and elegant, reflecting high-end jewelry design.  The image should have a photorealistic style, emphasizing realistic textures and subtle reflections.  The model's expression should be serene and slightly contemplative, focusing on the jewelry.
