A photorealistic close-up macro shot of a women's yellow gold ring featuring a vibrant, pear-cut blue topaz as the central pendant stone, securely held by eight meticulously crafted, slightly tapered prongs.  The gold is highly polished, exhibiting a warm, lustrous sheen with subtle reflections of soft, diffused studio lighting. The diamonds, eight in total, are brilliant-cut, showcasing exceptional sparkle and fire. They are set along the ring band, creating a halo effect around the topaz. The ring band itself is subtly textured with a fine, almost invisible, brushed finish providing a matte contrast to the polished prongs and setting.  The diamonds exhibit a high refractive index, capturing and scattering the light beautifully. The background is a minimalist, dark velvety black, providing a dramatic contrast that highlights the ring's brilliance.  The overall mood is luxurious and elegant.  The ring is slightly elevated, showcasing its form and details optimally. The image should emphasize the luxurious feel, while accurately reflecting the way the ring would appear when worn by a Black woman. The topaz should show deep saturated color without appearing overly artificial. The image should exhibit a high level of detail and realism, comparable to high-end jewelry photography.(Model: 5c232a9e-9061-4777-980a-ddc8e65647c6)
